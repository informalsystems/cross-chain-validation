# Initialization

This documents tackles the initialization part of the cross-chain validation (CCV) protocol.
Namely, we need to ensure that (1) parent blockchain communicates with baby blockchain, (2) baby blockchain communicates with parent blockchain, and (3) these two blockchains communicate via a single channel.

We start by properly defining the properties of the initialization subprotocol.
Then, we provide the pseudocode and prove its correctness.

## Problem Definition

We assume that babyChain denotes the baby blockchain the parent blockchain wants to validate.
Similarly, parentChain denotes the parent blockchain which validates the baby blockchain, from the perspective of the baby blockchain.

The initialization exposes the following interface:
- Indication <Open, channel>: channel is open.

We ensure the following properties:

- **Parent Safety:** If <Open, channel> is triggered at parent blockchain, then channel is a channel between the parent and baby blockchain.

- **Baby Safety:** If <Open, channel> is triggered at baby blockchain, then channel is a channel between the parent and baby blockchain.

- **Channel Safety:** If <Open, channel> is triggered at parent blockchain and <Open, channel'> is triggered at baby blockchain, these channel = channel'.

- **No Duplication:** A blockchain triggers <Open, channel> at most once.

- **Liveness:** A blockchain eventually triggers <Open, channel>.

## Protocol

### Parent Blockchain

```
upon <OnChanOpenTry, Order order, String portId, String channelId, Counterparty counterparty, String version, String counterpartyVersion>:
    // validate parameters, i.e., check whether order = "ORDERED", portId is the expected port, version is the expected version
    if (!validate(order, portId, channelId, version)):
        trigger <error>

    // check whether the version of the counterparty is the expected one
    if (counterpartyVersion != expectedCCVVersion):
        trigger <error>

    // create the channel, i.e., claim a capability
    Channel channel = new Channel(portId, channelId)
    // set its status to "INITIALIZING"
    channel.setStatus("INITIALIZING")

    // get the client
    client = getClient(channelId)

    // verify consensus state
    verifyConsensusState(client, initialValidatorSetBaby)

    // verify that there does not exist a CCV channel
    if (ccvChannelBaby != nil):
        trigger <error>
```

- Expected precondition
    - Handshake is started for establishing a channel
- Expected postcondition
    - A channel(portId, channelId) is created; its status is set to "INITIALIZING"
- Error pcondition
    - None

```
upon <OnChanOpenConfirm, String portId, String channelId>:
    // verify that there does not exist a CCV channel
    if (ccvChannelBaby != nil):
        // if there is, make it invalid and close it
        ccvChannel.setStatus("INVALID")
        ccvChannel.close()
        trigger <error>
    
    // update the channel
    ccvChannel = getChannel(channelId)
    // make it valid
    ccvChannel.setStatus("VALID")

    // terminate
    trigger <Terminate, blockchain, ccvChannel>
```

- Expected precondition
    - Handshake is started for establishing a channel
- Expected postcondition
    - ccvChannel variable is updated with a channel for CCV; status set to "VALID"
    - blockchain triggers <Terminate, blockchain, ccvChannel>
-Error condition
    - None

### Baby Blockchain

```
upon <OnChanOpenInit, Order order, String portId, String channelId, Counterparty counterparty, String version:
    // validate parameters, i.e., check whether order = "ORDERED", portId is the expected port, version is the expected version
    if (!validate(order, portId, channelId, version)):
        trigger <error>

    // create the channel, i.e., claim a capability
    Channel channel = new Channel(portId, channelId)
    // set its status to "INITIALIZING"
    channel.setStatus("INITIALIZING")

    // get the client
    client = getClient(channelId)

    // verify that the client is the expected client
    (client != expectedClient):
        trigger <error>
```

- Expected precondition
    - Handshake is started for establishing a channel
- Expected postcondition
    - A channel(portId, channelId) is created; its status is set to "INITIALIZING"
- Error condition
    - None

```
upon <OnChanOpenAck, String portId, String channelId, String counterpartyVersion>:
    // check the version of the counterparty
    if (counterpartyVersion != expectedVersion): 
        trigger <error>    
    
    trigger <Terminate, parentChain, getChannel(channelId)>
```

- Expected precondition
    - Handshake is started for establishing a channel
- Expected postcondition
    - blockchain triggers <Terminate, blockchain, ccvChannel>
- Error condition
    - None

## Correctness Arguments

- **Parent Safety:** This property is satisfied because the underlying client is the one expected and the consensus state of the baby blockchain is verified.

- **Baby Safety:** 

- **Channel Safety:**

- **No Duplication:** A blockchain triggers <Open, channel> at most once.

- **Liveness:** A blockchain eventually triggers <Open, channel>.
